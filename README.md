# hello-world
My first GitHub repo. Just getting used to the platform.

My name is Shayne. I am a novice software developer fluent in Swift for iOS and learning new languages when I can.

I am a full-time railroad conductor in New York and I love my job. I do freelance software developement for fun and extra money.
